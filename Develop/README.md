## Usage

    To use Snakey Generator: Password Manager the user simply has to navigate to the root directory of the application and simply enter "python main.py" into the command line. Then the user will be prompted with a button and on click that button will generate a secure password for the user.

## Packages

    undefined

## Features
  
   This application is able to generate passwords between 12 and 124 characters that include lowercase letters, upper case letters, as well as special characters. This password generator randomizes these characters for the most secure password generation possible and if a user is unhappy with the password they generated they may simply click the generate button again for an entirely new password.
  
## Resources
  
   I used three seperate python libraries including secrets for generating random characters, string for outputtng the password string, and tkinter for displaying a gui.
  
## Tests

   A user can test this application by cloning the repository and and testing it under varius conditions.
